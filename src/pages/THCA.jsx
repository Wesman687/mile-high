        <h1>WHAT IS THCa?</h1>
        <p>
          Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) is a type of chemical called a
          cannabinoid in the cannabis plant that may have potential medicinal
          use. It's also popular because you can heat it to change it into
          another type of cannabinoid, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or delta-9
          THC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants that are a part of
          the same species. THCA is found in the flowers of the cannabis plant.
          There's usually more THCA in fresh cannabis plants, especially in raw
          cannabis buds, compared to dried plants.{" "}
        </p>
      
      <p>
        You can get THCA from buying hemp, which isn's under the same controls
        as marijuana. Then, after heating it up, you can convert it into THC and
        get high. People use this method if they can't access marijuana or if
        it's illegal where they live.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference between marijuana and hemp is how much THC they contain.
        Hemp(THCA) is defined as having less than 0.3% of THC while marijuana
        contains more. Hemp doesn't have enough THC to cause a high, but it does
        contain THC.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        When THCA is heated, smoked, or vaped, it turns into THC. THC is the
        main ingredient in cannabis that can give you that high, euphoric
        feeling.
      </p>
      <h1>THCA comes in different forms:</h1>
      <h1>The actual flower of the plant</h1>
      <h1>A patch</h1>
      <h1>Diamond Crystals</h1>
      <h1>Edible forms, like gummies. You can also eat the buds raw.</h1>
      <p>
        If you were to extract THCA and consume it, it may have therapeutic
        effects helpful for pain relief for nausea. It won't make you feel high
        though.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you smoke or vaporize THCA, it instantly changes into THC, which can
        produce a high.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a natural way that THCA can be turned into THC. Over time, if a
        cannabis plant spends too much time in the sun, the heat and oxygen will
        change the THCA molecules into THC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of whether you consume THCA or THC, both can have effects on
        your body.
      </p>
      <p>
        THCA is getting more popular because it's legal and accessible in most
        states in the U.S. THCA is legal as long as the cannabis contains less
        than 0.3% of it. State laws can vary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marijuana is regulated by the federal government as a controlled
        substance, but hemp isn't. While hemp isn't federally regulated as a
        controlled substance, it can be changed to produce the same THC in
        marijuana. This can cause a legal loophole in areas where marijuana is
        illegal because you can buy THCA and alter it to get high the way you
        would with marijuana.
